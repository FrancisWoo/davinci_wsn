 one_outer_yaw_link is at trocar constraint point
 one_outer_pitch_link is also at trocar constraint point
 one_tool_main_link is back at motors location on prismatic joint, moving with tool

 one_psm_base_link is stationary, w/ 
                origin at constraint point, 
                z-axis "up" and 
                y-axis colinear w/ first joint (yaw= tilt) axis, pointing AWAY from base

 one_outer_yaw_link:
                origin coincident w/ one_psm_base_link at constraint point
                z-axis points along yaw tilt axis of jnt1, w/ z pointing TOWARDS base
                at jnt1-ang=0, z-axis is UP
                child: one_outer_pitch_link

  one_outer_pitch_link:
                origin coincident w/ constraint point
                z-axis is axis of rotation, positive to robot's LEFT, 
                     is coincident with y-axis of parent frame
                at jnt2-ang = 0, y-axis of one_outer_pitch_link is coincident
                     w/ x-axis of one_outer_yaw_link, which points along tool centerline TOWARDS motors

  one_tool_main_link:
                origin is at motors on tool; 
                z-axis points along tool centerline, from motors towards gripper;
                x-axis points back towards base (y-axis is to robot's left)
                child is one_tool_wrist_link

  one_tool_wrist_link:
