checkerboard folder should be placed in the .gazebo/models directory
can then load checkerboard via gazebo model insert menu


set up sys with:
roslaunch dvrk_model wsn_davinci_gazebo.launch
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun davinci_traj_streamer davinci_traj_interpolator_as
from: ros_ws/src/davinci_wsn/davinci_playfiles
  rosrun playfile_reader playfile_cartspace retract.csp

just to get arms out of the way;
  may play with directional or spot lights in gazebo to get good lighting of checkerboard

in gazebo, from "insert" menu, choose "checkerboard"
node: 
   rosrun move_gazebo_model move_calibration_checkerboard

then: rosservice call trigger_service 1 (to trigger advancing checkerboard through scenes)

 moves model checkerboard in gazebo to different poses, for use with camera calibration.

In gazebo, set physics/gravity to zero, so checkerboard does not fall

for stereo calibration, run:

rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --approximate 0.1 --size 7x6 --square 0.02 right:= /davinci/right_camera/image_raw left:=/davinci/left_camera/image_raw right_camera:=/davinci/right_camera left_camera:=/davinci/left_camera

mono: 
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 7x6 --square 0.02 image:=/davinci/left_camera/image_raw camera:=/davinci/left_camera

needs debugging. mono calibration looks promising, but does not acquire enough samples to satisfy "skew"
